# ATLA React Memory Game

## Description
This is a simple React app that allows the user to match similar images in a small grid. User must match correct images in order for the card to remain flipped. If incorrect, the cards flip back over. I built this project to become more familiar with React and further my knowledge of useState and CSS tricks, as that is something I want to become stronger with. I am currently working on a system that tracks the user's score and a method to display said scores on the page. I learned that everything on the page uses state and can be tied to a component page.

## Install
When completed one must simply run `npm run develop` to build the app after installing all the necessary npm packages.

## Usage
Video and screenshots to follow.
